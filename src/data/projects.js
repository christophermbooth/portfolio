    Description: "Prost aims to create safe drinking environments. Users can go solo or create parties and place themselves on our map to be seen by the public or only their friends. Privacy is a big concern here and users have complete control over who they share their location with. Users can create a friends list, plan events through private messages, check their area for new spots to frequent or curate a list of their favorite watering holes, view the varying status of any of the participating bars and restaurants including population, indoor / outdoor, masks or no masks, etc. On the other hand, if you are a business owner, register with us and experience a new, fluid method of communication with your customers. Alert them to promotions, popup events, crowd numbers, and keep them up to date about the going-ons in your business."

    Description: "On the Road is a tool for the especially adventurous road tripper who jumps at any chance to sleep outside and under the stars. Travelers upload information for their upcoming road trips, and in turn, On the Road provides them public campsites for each night theyâ€™ll be en route based on their desired daily drive time. After a trip has been created, travelers will gain access to a journal associated with that trip where they upload notes or photos as a way to preserve their fond memories."
